## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Learned theming with styled components, pagination with ReactJS, and discovered how insanely annoying it can be to style select forms, lol...

It's wrong to nest interactive html elements like a tags in a button for example

```html
<button>
  <a href="#"> Click me </a>
</button>
```
